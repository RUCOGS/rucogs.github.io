This semester's theme was "**Vanish**," but we couldn't stop the creative games from appearing!

We got some great submissions, like the eerie horror survival [Reality Collapse Zone](https://dodawu.itch.io/reality-collapse-zone) and the stylish cyberpunk hack-n-slash [Vanish](https://renjiji.itch.io/vanish). Meanwhile, [VanISH](https://atlinx.itch.io/vanish) came out, stunning with its assets and a creative double meaning on the theme's name. 

While this jam might disappear into the sands of time, the innovative, inventive and interesting games that our participants gave us won't be vanishing from our memory any time soon.
