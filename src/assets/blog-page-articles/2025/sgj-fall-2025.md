This semester's theme was "**9 to 5**," but our submissions were anything but boring!

With a record high turnout, our members were ready to clock in and out with amazing submissions like the stylish math puzzle-battler [Nine to NaN](https://utinj.itch.io/nine-to-nan), or the delightfully dreary [Gas and Mimics](https://renjiji.itch.io/gas-and-mimic) that really wants to ask for your papers, please. Featuring guest appearances from Dolly Parton in [Traffic Jam](https://skullmbones.itch.io/traffic-jam) and the *actual assembly code compiler* of [some_Assembly_Required](https://alxjay.itch.io/some-assembly-required), this game jam felt absolutely nothing like work.

But now that we return to the doldrums of normalcy, the 9-to-5 of life, these games will stay with us for a lot longer than the 8 hours on the clock.

We had a few awards this time too. The winners were:
- MVP Award: [Gas and Mimics](https://renjiji.itch.io/gas-and-mimic)
- Excellence in Design: [The Boss Level](https://wowus03.itch.io/the-boss-level)
- Innovative Theme Interpretation: [Teacher's Terror](https://urvigpatel.itch.io/teachers-terror)
- COGS' Choice (Popular Vote): [The Boss Level](https://wowus03.itch.io/the-boss-level)
