<app-section title="FAQ" color="primary" dog-ear last>
  <mat-accordion>
    <app-question-panel title="What is Scarlet Game Jam?">
      <p>Scarlet Game Jam is an annual game jam hosted by COGS for all Rutgers students and staff! Similar to any other
        game jam, participants will be given a weekend to design and code a game to show off at the end of
        the jam. At the beginning of each Scarlet Game Jam we will also be unveiling the (optional) theme to inspire or
        challenge our participants which changes with every scarlet game jam, so each year is a new experience!</p>
      <p class="mb-0">Participants can join our game jam solo or in a group, its up to you! No experience is required
        either, so feel free to join regardless of your game design experience. Have no experience and no friends to
        join with? No worries, at the beginning of every game jam we offer a team assembly time where you can get to
        know other jammers and team up (or not) to make some amazing games by the end of the event.</p>
    </app-question-panel>
    <app-question-panel title="Where does Scarlet Game Jam take place?">
      <p>Scarlet Game Jam takes place over the weekend, but we're not going to keep you in place for that long.
        We understand you're busy college students (we are too!) so the large majority of Scarlet Game Jam actually
        takes place wherever you want it to. This means you can work in the comfort of your home (dorm, apartment, ...),
        the library, the dining hall, a table in the Yard, literally anywhere. We do this so that you can work around
        your schedule and, if working with other people, find the perfect time to meet for your group without having to
        worry about our availability or the availability of a single room.</p>
      <p class="mb-0">There are portions of Scarlet Game Jam in person, though, those being: {{startDate}}, where you
        can brainstorm with other people, form a group if you want, and just hang out in general; And {{endDate}}, the
        end, where you get to show off your game, see what other people have made, and reminisce over the marathon you
        just sat through (and hopefully how fun it was!).</p>
    </app-question-panel>
    <app-question-panel title="Who can come?">
      <p class="mb-0">Scarlet Game Jam is open to ALL Rutgers students, faculty, and staff. Because of this, Scarlet
        Game Jam is a great networking/social event where you can meet fellow Rutgers people and form friendships,
        partnerships, or whatever. Nothing says you have to stop working on your game after the game jam either. If you
        like your project and you've worked with some likeminded people, we encourage you to finish that game, polish it
        up, and then release it online for everyone to play (of course make sure to send us the steam link and maybe a
        key or two üòâ). </p>
    </app-question-panel>
    <app-question-panel title="Can non-Rutgers students come?">
      <p class="mb-0">Yes!</p>
    </app-question-panel>
    <app-question-panel title="What if I can't code?">
      <p class="mb-0">COGS is the perfect place for people who want to explore ALL aspects of game development. This
        means we accept all artists, music composers, programmers, etc with open arms! If you have an idea for a game,
        or just want to learn how to make them, COGS will help you find a place to apply what you're good at.</p>
    </app-question-panel>
    <app-question-panel title="What can we do with our games?">
      <p class="mb-0">Your team owns 100% of the game you make during jam. Feel free to turn your game jam games into a
        full release if you think the game has potential. </p>
