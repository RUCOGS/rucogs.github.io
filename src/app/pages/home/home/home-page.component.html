      <p class="mb-0">
        Tuesdays 7pm - 9pm in CoRE 301.<br />

    <app-question-panel title="What are the goals of the club?">
      <p>
        At COGS we like to enjoy, develop, and be inspired by both games and game development. We provide the resources
        for both leader-led projects, where a club leader with experience will guide the development of a game, and for
        other members' individual projects.
      </p>
    </app-question-panel>
    <app-question-panel title="What if I can't code?">
      <p>
        COGS is the perfect place for people who want to explore ALL aspects of game development. This means we accept
        all artists, music composers, programmers, etc with open arms! If you have an idea for a game, or just want to
        learn how to make them, COGS will help you find a place to apply what you're good at.
      </p>
    </app-question-panel>
    <app-question-panel title="How does COGS help me?">
      <p class="mb-0">
        Since what we do as a whole involves working, discussing, and creating projects in a team-based environment,
        your experience at COGS will be a good point of reference for your resume, and contribute to your portfolio of
        projects. Also, COGS is the perfect place to find friends who love games just as much as you do!
